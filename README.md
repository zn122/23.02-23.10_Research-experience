- Use tabular data to predict mild cognitive impairment

1. Since the missing value of the data affects the prediction, 'missing data imputation' was performed to replace the missing value with an appropriate value.

2. The imbalance of data of mild cognitive impairment also affects the prediction. Therefore oversampling was performed to increase minority data from an unbalanced data set.
